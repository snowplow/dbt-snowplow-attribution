snowplow-attribution 0.2.2 (2024-06-19)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release fixes a bug in the source_checks() macro that could fail if the `snowplow__conversions_source` or `snowplow__conversion_path_source` variables are overwritten. This fix should allow users to provide a `schema.table` or `warehouse.schema.table` style string reference for these sources without having to specify a dbt source in their project (similar to the default), if necessary.

## Fixes
- Fix source checks macro

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-unified version in your `packages.yml` file.

snowplow-attribution 0.2.1 (2024-06-11)
---------------------------------------
## Summary
This release removes null user_identifier data when the conversions_source and path_source are joined. Previously catching nulls on this field was reliant on tests only in the Unified package which was removed as it is easier to enforce this directly in the model itself.

## Features
- Exclude null user identifiers from sources

## Under the hood
- Add Redshift to tests

## Upgrading
Bump the snowplow-unified version in your `packages.yml` file.
